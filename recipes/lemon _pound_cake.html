  <h3>For the Meyer lemon glaze</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
    <li>2-3 tablespoons fresh Meyer lemon juice</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Preheat the oven to 325°F.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mix the flour, baking powder, and baking soda in a medium bowl. Reserve.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the bowl of your stand mixer with the paddle attachment,
      beat the butter and the cream cheese at medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the sugar and beat until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the eggs, one at a time, and beat until well combined.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the vanilla extract and the lemon juice and beat.
    </li>
    <li>
      Reduce the speed and add the flour mixture. Beat until blended and smooth.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the lemon zest and fold with a silicon spatula.
    </li>
    <li>
      Spray a Bundt cake pan with baking spray.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pour the batter into the prepared Bundt pan and bake for 55 minutes, until a toothpick
      inserted in the center of the pan comes out clean.
    </li>
    <li>
      Transfer the cake pan to a cooling rack.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the meantime, make the lemon syrup in a small bowl by combining the sugar and the lemon juice.
      Stir until the sugar dissolves completely.
    </li>
    <li>
      With a bamboo skewer, poke the still-warm cake and drizzle half of the syrup with a spoon.
    </li>
    <li>
      After 10 minutes, unmold the pan over the rack. Place the rack on a baking sheet, and brush the rest of the syrup.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make the glaze by combining powdered sugar and lemon juice in a medium bowl. Add the lemon juice one tablespoon at
      a time.
      Whisk vigorously until a thick glaze is formed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Drizzle the glaze on top of the cake. Let the glaze set, and transfer the cake to a cake plate.
    </li>
  </ol>
