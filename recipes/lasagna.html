  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    In this eggplant lasagna, traditional lasagna sheets are replaced with thinly sliced eggplant,
    layered with a rustic tomato sauce, and topped off with fresh mozzarella.
  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1 cup onion finely chopped, or ground in a food processor</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves minced</li>
    <li>2 pounds Roma tomatoes peeled and ground in a food processor</li>
    <li>Coarse sea salt</li>
    <li>2 large unpeeled eggplants finely sliced lengthwise</li>
    <li>1/2 cup fresh basil leaves thinly sliced in chiffonade</li>
    <li>1 cup of mozzarella cheese sliced</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Add 2 tablespoons olive oil to a saucepan at medium heat, and sauté the onion and garlic until wilted about 5-8
      minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring, until boiling. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.
      Uncover and simmer for an additional 10 minutes. If your sauce has too much liquid, simmer until it reduces to a
      thick,
      hearty consistency: you aim for a robust tomato purée. Reserve.
    </li>
    <li>
      Preheat a cast iron grilling pan (or another grilling pan) to medium-high heat.
    </li>
    <li>
      Give a few brushes of olive oil to the eggplant slices, sprinkle with salt, grill them on the cast iron pan,
      and cook for 2-3 minutes until the grilling marks are formed. Flip the slices and cook for 1 more minute.
      Reserve and continue until all the eggplants are grilled.
    </li>
    <li>
      Preheat the oven to 350°F.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cover the bottom of the baking dish with a single layer of eggplant slices.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add a layer of tomato, about 3/4 cup of tomato sauce, and a sprinkle of basil. Repeat.
    </li>
    <li>
      On top of the last layer of eggplant, add the remaining tomato sauce,
      basil and evenly distribute the mozzarella on top. The cheese is always the final layer.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes until the mozzarella melts.
    </li>
    <li>
      Uncover. Increase the oven temperature to 375°F and bake for 8-10 minutes until the top is golden brown.
    </li>
    <li>
      Allow to cool for at least 10 minutes before serving.
    </li>
  </ol>
