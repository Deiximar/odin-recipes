  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    This is the best Venezuelan ponche crema recipe ever, especially because it’s as thick and creamy as it gets.
  </p>
  <p>
    This Venezuelan eggnog is made out of egg yolks, sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and, of course,
    our delicious aged rum! The best part, you won’t need to add either cornstarch or ready-to-make flan powder.
  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>5 egg yolks</li>
    <li>1 can sweetened condensed milk</li>
    <li>1 can evaporated milk</li>
    <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
    <li>1 cup aged rum</li>
    <li>2 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      In a bowl and with the help of an electric mixer, beat the yolks until a pale yellow cream is formed, about 10-12
      minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add sweetened condensed milk and beat until a homogeneous mixture is formed about 1 more minute.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add evaporated milk and mix until incorporated.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bring the mixture of yolks and milk to a pot and turn the heat to medium-low. Cook, constantly stirring with a
      wooden spoon, for about 12-15 minutes. It is imperative not to leave the pot unattended at any time to prevent the
      punch from sticking or clumping.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove from heat. Add the rum and vanilla extract, and stir. You can discard or not the cinnamon stick. Stir, and
      with the help of a funnel, transfer the punch to a sterilized bottle.
      Chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours before serving.
    </li>
    <li>
      Unlike other punches that have to be left to thicken for several days in the refrigerator, this one is so thick
      that
      you can drink it immediately.
    </li>
    <li> You can serve it on its own or with ice.
    </li>
  </ol>
